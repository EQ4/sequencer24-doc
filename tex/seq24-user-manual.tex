\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Seq24} \cite{seq24},
   through version 0.9.2, dated approximately to 2010.

   \textsl{Seq24} is
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface more like a hardware sequencer
   than the typical software MIDI sequencer.  The contents of this document
   are derived in part from existing documents, such as the \texttt{SEQ24}
   file shipped with the \textsl{Seq24} source code, and a printout from a
   long-lost wiki.

   \textsl{Seq24} is not a synthesizer.  One needs hardware synthesizer, or
   a software synthesizer such as
   Timidity \cite{timidity},
   FluidSynth \cite{fluidsynth},
   ZynAddSubYX \cite{zynaddsubfx} and Yoshimi \cite{yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi2},
   AmSynth \cite{amsynth},
   Bristol \cite{bristol},
   and others (see \cite{linuxsynths} for a fairly comprehensive list of
   "Linux" synthesizers).

   \textsl{Seq24} is meant to work a bit like an Alesis SR16 drum machine,
   which, for some, is a very intuitive and fast way to do MIDI.
   If one has worked with trackers like \textsl{SoundTracker} and
   \textsl{ShakeTracker}, then "you are a tracker guy and it gonna go fast".
   With \textsl{Seq24}, one creates several patterns, and then combines them.

   There are a number of current authors of \texttt{Seq24} today,
   as one can see in
   \figureref{fig:seq24_menu_help_credits},
   and it
   \figureref{fig:seq24_menu_help_doc}.
   The original author is Rob C. Buse; where the word "I" occurs, that is
   probably him.

   Now, unfortunately, \textsl{Seq24} is not currently under active
   development (2010 seems to be the last update).  There are a number of
   half-hearted forks for it on \textsl{GitHub}, including some conversions
   to Java-based and browser-based code.  One of the fork consists of some
   patches for LASH support, which should be incorporated at some point.
   \textsl{Seq24} could use a few more features, such as "infinite
   patterns" (i.e. tracks), better annunciation of mouse modes,
   ways to work around the need for two mice, a more up-to-date GUI,
   a few bug fixes, fix the formating of out rc files,
   and a way to edit parts of the MIDI file textually.

   So, why would we bother with \textsl{Seq24}?  The next section answers,
   in pretty much the original author's words.

\subsection{Seq24: What and Why?}
\label{subsec:introduction_seq24_vs_others}

   \texttt{Seq24} is a real-time MIDI sequencer. It was created to 
   provide a very simple interface for editing and playing 
   MIDI 'loops'. After searching for a software based 
   sequencer that would provide the functionality needed for 
   a live performance, there was little found in the 
   software realm. I set out to create a very minimal sequencer 
   that excludes the bloated features of the large software 
   sequencers, and includes a small subset of features that 
   I have found usable in performing. 

   \begin{quotation}
      Written by Rob C. Buse.  I wrote this program to fill a
      hole.  I figure it would be a waste if I was the only one
      using it.  So, I released it under the GPL.
   \end{quotation}

   Taking advantage of Rob's migh morality, we've creating a continuation,
   minor fork, refactoring, fixing, improvements (we hope) of \textsl{Seq24}
   in a project called "Sequencer24" \cite{sequencer24}.  It preserves the
   lean nature of \textsl{Seq24}, and might even make it a bit leaner, while
   adding a few features we've found useful.  Stay tuned for a project that
   documents "Sequencer24" and its new features.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document is based on the user-interface of
   \textsl{Seq24}.
   The sections are basically provided
   in the order their contents appear in the user interface of
   \textsl{Seq24}.  To help the reader jump around this document, multiple
   links and references are supplied.

   Usage tips
   \index{tips!in document}
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Seq24} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tip:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   Bug notes
   \index{bugs!in document}
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Seq24} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "Bug:".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "bugs".

   TODO items
   \index{todo!in document}
   are also present, in the same vein.
   This document currently has a lot of them!

\subsection{Let's Get Started!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Seq24}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK}, which
   complicates the discussion of \textsl{Seq24}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Seq24} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Seq24} so that it uses ALSA for
   MIDI.  Provide a default MIDI file so that all elements of the user
   interface can come into play.
   Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.
%   See \sectionref{sec:seq24_man_page}.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ seq24 click_4_4.midi &
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{seq24-first-screen.png}
   \caption{Seq24 Main Screen}
   \label{fig:seq24_main_screen}
\end{figure}

%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{seq24-first-screen.jpg}
%  That figure a bit out-of-date (it does not show the new "Part of"
%  feature), so we've replaced it with a new screen capture.
   
   Then the \textsl{Seq24} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:seq24_main_screen}.

   \index{tooltips}
   As with most user-interfaces, holding the mouse over any button for a
   short period will let one view a short description (tooltip)
   of what it does.

   The \textsl{Seq24} program is basically a loop playing machine with a 
   simple interface.  Before we describe this interface, it is useful to
   present some concepts.
