\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Sequencer24}
   \cite{seq24},
   through version 0.9.4, dated approximately September, 2015.

\subsection{Sequencer24: What?}
\label{subsec:what_is_seqeuncer24}

   \textsl{Sequencer24} is an continuation of \textsl{Seq24},
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface more like a hardware sequencer
   than the typical software MIDI sequencer.

   \textsl{Sequencer24} is not a synthesizer.  One needs hardware
   synthesizer, or a software synthesizer such as Timidity \cite{timidity},
   FluidSynth \cite{fluidsynth}, ZynAddSubYX \cite{zynaddsubfx} and Yoshimi
   \cite{yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi2}, AmSynth \cite{amsynth}, Bristol
   \cite{bristol}, and many others (see \cite{linuxsynths} for a fairly
   comprehensive list of "Linux" synthesizers).

   \textsl{Sequencer24}, like \textsl{Seq24},
   is meant to work a bit like an Alesis SR16 drum machine,
   which, for some, is a very intuitive and fast way to do MIDI.
   If one has worked with trackers like \textsl{SoundTracker} and
   \textsl{ShakeTracker}, then "you are a tracker guy and it gonna go fast".
   With \textsl{Sequencer24}, one creates several patterns, and then
   combines them.

   There are a number of authors of \textsl{Seq24}, and currently only
   one author of \textsl{Sequencer24},
   as one can see in \figureref{fig:seq24_menu_help_credits},
   and in \figureref{fig:seq24_menu_help_doc}.
   All of these authors have contributed to \textsl{Sequencer24}, whether
   they know it or not.
   The original author is Rob C. Buse; where the word "I" occurs, that is
   probably him.

   Now, unfortunately, \textsl{Seq24} is not currently under active
   development (2010 seems to be the last update).  There are a number of
   half-hearted forks for it on \textsl{GitHub}, and some conversions
   to Java-based and browser-based code, and some patches.
   So, why would we bother creating another fork of \textsl{Seq24}?

\subsection{Sequencer24: Why?}
\label{subsec:introduction_seq24_vs_others}

   Although a good program at present, \textsl{Seq24} could use a few more
   features, such as "infinite patterns" (i.e. tracks), better annunciation,
   uniformity, and ease-of-use
   of mouse modes, ways to work around the need for two mouse buttons, a more
   up-to-date GUI, a few bug fixes, fix the formatting of the output "rc"
   files, and a way to edit parts of the MIDI file textually.

   \begin{quotation}
      \textsl{Seq24} is a real-time MIDI sequencer. It was created to
      provide a very simple interface for editing and playing MIDI 'loops'.
      After searching for a software based sequencer that would provide the
      functionality needed for a live performance, there was little found in
      the software realm. I set out to create a very minimal sequencer that
      excludes the bloated features of the large software sequencers, and
      includes a small subset of features that I have found usable in
      performing. 

      Written by Rob C. Buse.  I wrote this program to fill a
      hole.  I figure it would be a waste if I was the only one
      using it.  So, I released it under the GPL.
   \end{quotation}

   This project deserves to stay alive!
   Taking advantage of Rob's generosity, we've created a continuation,
   a minor fork, a refactoring, an improvement (we hope) of
   \textsl{Seq24} in this project.  It preserves the lean nature of
   \textsl{Seq24}, and might even make it a bit leaner, while adding a few
   features we've found useful.
   
   Without \textsl{Seq24} and its authors, \textsl{Sequencer24} would never
   have come into being.

\subsection{Improvements}
\label{subsec:improvements}

   The following improvements have been made to \textsl{Seq24} to
   create \textsl{Sequencer24}:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item The code was reformmated using \textsl{astyle} and some of our
         own personal preferences.  Modules were split into smaller units.
         Header file "includes" were moved into the "cpp" files to reduce
         header-file dependencies and build times, and to facilitate
         understanding of the code.
      \item Much documentation was added to the code as we tried to figure
         out how it worked.  Generation of Doxygen output (including a PDF
         file) was added to provide a developer's reference manual.
      \item Debian packaging was incorporated into the project to make it
         easier to install without the source code.  Bootstrapping and
         packing scripts were added so that other developers can rebuild the
         project from scratch.
      \item Various fixes (patches) found by searching the web were manually
         incorporated into the code.  Fixes to bugs found while refactoring
         \textsl{Seq24} were also made.  These fixes are noted in detail in
         the project's ROADMAP file.
      \item Various minor features were added:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Patterns/sequences/loops that are empty of MIDI events are
            now highlighted in yellow boxes, and are completely ignored at
            playback time.
         \item More musical scales (harmonic minor, melodic minor, and
            C whole tone scales) were added.
         \item The application now, by default, writes its MIDI files out
            in a completely MIDI-compliant format which should be readable
            by other MIDI software.  A "legacy" option allows
            \textsl{Sequencer24} to write its MIDI files in the
            \textsl{Seq24} format.
         \item The size of the Patterns Panel (main windows) is now locked,
            since enlarging it offers no benefits.
         \item Support for LASH is now a run-time option (as well as a build
            option).
         \item Support for using the Mod4 (Windows) key to lock the
            right-click note-editing mode in the Pattern Editor has been
            added, to support suboptimal laptop trackpads.
         \item Support for reading and writing configuration files from the
            user's \texttt{\$HOME/.config/sequencer24} directory.
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

   In the future, version 1.0 will be even more object-oriented, hopefully
   even faster, and easier to modify.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document is based on the user-interface of
   \textsl{Sequencer24}.  The sections are basically provided in the order
   their contents appear in the user interface of \textsl{Sequencer24}.  To
   help the reader jump around this document, multiple links, references,
   and index entries are provided.

   Usage tips
   \index{tips!in document}
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Sequencer24} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "\textbf{Tip:}".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   Bug notes
   \index{bugs!in document}
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Sequencer24} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "\textbf{Bug:}".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "bugs".  These bugs are items that we will try to
   get rid of as time goes on.

   "To-do" items
   \index{todo!in document}
   are also present, in the same vein.
   Each to-do occurs in a sentence beginning with "\textbf{TODO:}".
   This document currently has a lot of them!

   New features (post version 0.9.2) will be noted with the tag
   "\textbf{New:}".

\subsection{Let's Get Started!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Sequencer24}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK},
   which complicates the discussion of \textsl{Sequencer24}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Sequencer24} or hearing two
    sounds simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Sequencer24} so that it uses ALSA for MIDI.  Provide a
   default MIDI file so that all elements of the user interface can come
   into play.  Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.

%   See \sectionref{sec:seq24_man_page}.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ sequencer24 b4uacuse-seq24.midi &
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{seq24-first-screen.png}
   \caption{Sequencer24 Main Screen}
   \label{fig:seq24_main_screen}
\end{figure}

   Then the \textsl{Sequencer24} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:seq24_main_screen}.  It has a few minor differences
   from the \textsl{Seq24} main window, including the highlighting of
   empty patterns in yellow.

   \index{tooltips}
   As with most user-interfaces, holding the mouse over any button for a
   short period will let one view a short description (tooltip)
   of what it does.

   The \textsl{Sequencer24} program is basically a loop-playing machine with a 
   fairly simple interface.  Before we describe this interface, it is useful
   to present some concepts.
