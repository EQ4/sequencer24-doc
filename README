Sequencer24 User Manual
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-08-31 to 2015-08-31

This project provides two things:

   1. A user manual for Sequencer24, a continuation of the simple, but
      powerful, looping sequencer for Linux, Seq24.

   2. Sample items to accompany the manual.

To recreate the PDF file (the latest version is stored in the "pdf"
directory), you will need to install GNU make, latexmk, tex-live, pdf2latex,
and other resources related to LaTeX and PDF support.  If everything is
in place, then change to the "tex" directory, and a simple "make" command
will create the document.

"make clean" in the top-level directory or the "tex" directory will remove
all of the generated products.

Lastly, although this manual is well underway, it needs a lot of work and
a lot of help!
